### Introduction
`rs-api` is an open source wrapper, written with TypeScript using the [TypeScript library starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter), for the popular MMORPG RuneScape.

NOTE: version 3 has many different signatures than version 2. v2 is still able to be used, but will not receive any updates. The lastest version of v2 is `2.6.4` which can be installed using `npm install rs-api@2.6.4`. The source can be viewed in the v2 branch.

### Installation
`npm install rs-api@3.0.0-alpha.1`

### Usage
Documentation can be found at {insert here}

### Contribution
All `.ts` files are found in the `src` folder. The project is hooked in to scripts via the `package.json` scripts, such as `build`, `test`, `commit`, ect. See NPM scripts section below for more details.

This project is set up using `git-cz`. As such, upon committing, use `npm run commit` and fill the template out.
